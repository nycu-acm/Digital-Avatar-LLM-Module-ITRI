    "content": "●Temperature Regulation ─ Design concept: Trees can adjust the convection and circulation of hot and cold air to regulate temperature through shade reflection, blocking, and evapotranspiration. ─ Application scenario: A hot air outlet is set up on the skylight above the ecological tree, and the electricity generated by the SideLighter is provided for the fan on the canopy to blow downward, resulting in air circulation. ─ Features and benefits: The six fans enable 7.7 cycles of air circulation per hour in the central elevated area (with a volume of 2,646 m3). One of the fans is solar-powered and each generates an air output of 57 m3/min. ●Ambient Lighting ─ Design concept: In addition to environmental benefits, trees have the functions of sightseeing and landscaping for humans. ─ Application scenario: The ambient lighting created by light diffuser panels and LED lights sets off the shape of the ecological tree and adds aesthetic elements to the entire space. The indoor light can also adjust automatically in response to changes in sunlight. ─ Features and benefits:The diffuser panel has a light transmittance of 70% and a haze of 30%. The power consumption of the LED lamps is about 3,417 watts - 23% of the amount generated by colored halogen lamps with the same luminous flux.",

    "content": "●Water Purification ─ Design concept: The roots of trees can conserve water, and some aquatic plants can even decompose and purify water. ─ Application scenario: Qwater is a modularized water purification system that can be quickly assembled. The core technology is ITRI’s biomembrane filtration technology, an innovative water/wastewater treatment system that combines \"(biological) filter bed area\" and \"membrane separation area.\" ─ Features and benefits: Qwater technology is particularly suitable for raw water or low-concentration sewage treatment. It can also be applied to domestic sewage, industrial wastewater, car wash wastewater, simple community/school tap water treatment and greywater reuse, etc.",

    "content": "●Solar Power Generation ─ Design concept: Photosynthesis, a mechanism by which plants use sunlight to produce carbohydrates, is used as the design concept to highlight the value of solar energy. ─ Application scenario: ITRI’s SideLighter technology is installed on the skylight above the ecological tree to demonstrate how solar-powered windows use sunlight to generate electricity. ─ Features and benefits: Each SideLighter panel in the size of 110*90 cm (about 1 square meter) generates a power of 18 watts. There are 20 pieces of SideLighter on the treetop, with the total power generation reaching approximately 360 watts. ●Air Purification ─ Design concept: Trees can purify the air through the process of absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen during photosynthesis. In addition, the volatile substance phytoncides released by plants can also kill bacteria, pests and pathogens in the air. ─ Application scenario: The TiO2 nano-photocatalyst coated on the ecological tree canopy is used to kill airborne bacteria and decompose volatile organic compounds. ─ Features and benefits: When the fans in the canopy operate, the entire space can be ventilated through the photocatalyst coating area more than 7 times per hour, thus purifying the air. The antibacterial efficiency of the photocatalyst is up to 99.99%, and 1g of the nano-photocatalyst can decompose 20 µg of formaldehyde.",
