All-in-One Thermal Sensing System
Handheld Ultrasound System
All-in-One Thermal Sensing System
ITRI’s All-in-One Thermal Sensing System enables high-precision remote detection of vital signs and patient activities, meeting the demand for contactless smart healthcare in the post-pandemic world. Its AI-based ultra-resolution thermal image processing is privacy-preserving and can measure body temperature, heart rate and respiration rate for multiple subjects simultaneously. The system can also provide monitoring over bed-exits, falls, and prolonged sedentary time and will issue alerts via a mobile app when abnormality is detected. The compact design makes it an ideal tool for basic physiological assessment in clinics, wards, or homes, offering a cost-effective solution for telemedicine services.

Handheld Ultrasound System
The Handheld Ultrasound System includes a lightweight, portable scanner with a smart app, which allow physicians to perform ultrasound exams anywhere, anytime. This 64-channel system supports changeable transducers (linear 7.5MHz/convex 3.5MHz) and is able to process B-mode and color Doppler mode images. The system provides point-of-care ultrasonography for doctors to save critical time in emergency and intensive care. In the future, deep learning technology can be integrated to perform quantitative analysis of liver diseases for smart diagnosis.
生態樹 ─ 樹頂
●生態樹的應用情境－光合作用
─ 概念說明：光合作用是植物利用陽光來製造能量(碳水化合物)的一種機制。

─ 技術應用情境：於生態樹上方天窗架設工研院研發之「太陽能發電窗」技術，用以展示太陽能發電窗利用陽光發電的情境。

─ 技術應用特色與效益：每片太陽能發電窗尺寸是110*90公分（約1平方米），發電量是18瓦；在生態樹示範面積內有20片，總發電量約360瓦。

●生態樹的應用情境－淨化空氣
─ 概念說明：樹木透過光合作用中吸收二氧化碳與排放氧氣的過程，可達到淨化空氣的效果，此外植物散發的揮發性物質「芬多精」也可殺死空氣中的細菌、害蟲以及病原菌。

─ 技術應用情境：利用生態樹冠上塗層的自然光觸媒技術，來達到抵抗空間病菌及分解有機揮發氣體(VOC)的效果。

─ 技術應用特色與效益：樹冠內隱藏風扇可每小時讓整個空間換氣7次以上，並吹過光觸媒塗層區，淨化空氣。光觸媒抗菌效能可達99.99%，1g奈米光觸媒可分解20微克有機揮發性氣體（甲醛）。

Medical Implants for Hard-Soft Tissue Injuries
It is recognized that medical uses for 3D printing technology, both actual and potential, will bring revolutionary changes. Application of 3D model reconstruction, customized design and additive layer manufacturing technologies to design and manufacture the bio-active medical devices, such as bone screw and implants. The bio-active implants with flexible and microstructure design could reduce the rigidity of the implant and increase bone growth. In addition, a new generation of artificial ligaments using 3D bioactive composite scaffolds for tissue engineering could also achieve enhanced cell attachment and osseointegration in soft-tissue reconstruction.
MetabColor
ITRI's MetabColor microbial dyes feature a non-toxic, eco-friendly, and renewable textile dye manufacturing process. The dyes have brilliant color strength & fastness required for textile industry. The bio-based dyes are available in five colors including the proprietary MetaColor Black, the world’s first black dye without mixing concentrated color dyes.
Software-defined Augmented Robot Joint  : (SARJ)
ITRI's patented SARJ presents a modern and unique stacking design that features integrated high-power-density electric drive modules. SARJ has the highest torque-to-volume ratio in the industry, with 40% less body weight in comparison to robots of the same grade. SARJ's plug-and-play design also allows users to quickly build up customized and flexible multi-joint modular robots. Nowadays, this technology is used in the high-tech and precision machinery industries, but it has potential to be immersed into business, home appliance and medical fields.
