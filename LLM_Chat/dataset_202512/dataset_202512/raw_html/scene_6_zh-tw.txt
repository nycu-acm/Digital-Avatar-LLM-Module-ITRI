Ta-Hai Lee
Ta-Hai Lee graduated from the Department of Chemistry at National Southwestern Associated University. He worked as an assistant technician at Yung Shing Industries Lanzhou pharmaceutical factory and as an engineer at the Resources Commission Ganlan Oil & Mineral Bureau. After the retrocession of Taiwan in 1946, Mr. Lee joined a petroleum company and was responsible for the repair work at Kaohsiung Refinery. He was later temporarily transferred to China Technical Consultants and worked as a building & construction manager at Mu Hua Fertilizer Plant and Zhong Hai Lubricant Factory. He was a recipient of many construction awards.

In 1968, Mr. Lee was involved in the planning of No. 1 Naphtha Cracker, the foundation of Taiwan’s petrochemical industry development. Mr. Lee was later promoted to factory director. He upgraded and improved the cracking equipment and rapidly increased production. In 1976, Mr. Lee served as the General Manager of Chinese Petroleum Corporation and later became Chairman. During his term, the world was struggling through the second oil crisis. Mr. Lee did his best to stabilize oil prices, which was crucial to the domestic economy recovery. Mr. Lee served as the Minister of Economic Affairs in 1985 when Taiwan was facing pressure from the US that requested Taiwan to lower tariffs and cancel trade barriers to balance the growing trade deficit. Responsible for Taiwan's economic policies, Mr. Lee gradually loosened policies to balance the relations between Taiwan and the US.

Furthermore, Mr. Lee actively promoted domestic industrial upgrades and contributed much to many economic policies and measures aimed to make Taiwan a freer and more internationalized economy with a more structured system. In 1988, he was invited to serve as a National Policy Advisor to the President. Mr. Lee was the fourth Chairman of ITRI from 1994 to 1995.
