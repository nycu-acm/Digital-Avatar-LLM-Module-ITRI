ITRI Headquaters in the 1970s
"In the 1970s, Taiwan’s domestic industrial structure was under transformation. In response to the urgent need for the structural shift from labor-intensive to technology-intensive, the government led the establishment of the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in 1973, which shoulders the mission of leading the way in industrial technology. After that, ITRI sent technology elites to the US for learning and introducing advanced technologies from Europe and the US, which laid the foundation for the development of Taiwan’s semiconductor and precision industries.
The headquarters of ITRI is located in the Chung Hsing Campus in Hsinchu County."
Chao-Chen Wang
Chao-Chen Wang graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. He received his master’s degree in electrophysics and Ph.D. in science from Harvard University. Dr. Wang worked as a microwave electronics research engineer at the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and Westinghouse Electric Company. He was the chief electronics researcher and Director of electron optics at the Sperry Rand Company. He later served as an adjunct professor at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, Chair Professor at Cornell University, and ITRI’s first Chairman and President.

Dr. Wang was an internationally renowned electrophysicist and one of the top researchers specializing in the development of microwave diodes. In 1957, he was elected Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and in 1961 became Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1968, he was elected as one of the 7th Academicians of Academia Sinica.

In 1973, Dr. Wang returned to Taiwan from the US, prepared the establishment of ITRI, and served as ITRI’s first Chairman and President. In 1974, along with then Executive Yuan Secretary-General Hua Fei, Minister of Economic Affairs Yun-Suan Sun, Director General of Telecommunications Hsien-Chi Fang, Minister of Transportation and Communications Yu-Shu Kao, Telecommunication Laboratories Director Bao-Huang Kang, and RCA Laboratories Director Wen-Yuan Pan, Dr. Wang planned to bring in semiconductor manufacturing technology from the US. This encouraged the establishment of the Electronics Industry Research and Development Center within ITRI and the execution of the IC project, stimulating Taiwan’s electronics industry and economic development.

Dr. Wen-Yuan Pan introduces semiconductor technology to Taiwan.
In February 1974, then Executive Yuan Secretary-General Hua Fei, Minister of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Yun-Suan Sun, Director General of Telecommunications Hsien-Chi Fang, Minister of Transportation and Communications Yu-Shu Kao, ITRI President Chao-Chen Wang, Telecommunication Laboratories Director Bao-Huang Kang, and Radio Corporation of America (RCA) Laboratories Director Wen-Yuan Pan gathered at a small breakfast shop on Huaining St. in Taipei to work out Taiwan's “Future Path for Electronics Development.” Dr. Pan believed that, to speed up the growth of Taiwan’s electronics industry, integrated circuit (IC) would be the best investment, and introducing technology from the US would be the most efficient way to realize it. Later that year in July, Dr. Pan shut himself away in The Grand Hotel to draft the IC development project. With the full support from Minister Sun, the project was launched. The MOEA also set up the Electronics Industry Research and Development Center within ITRI.

Back then IC technology was considered very complex, and due to limited budget, Taiwan could only develop one technology. After considerable discussion, experts eventually decided to introduce CMOS technology. RCA, which had very mature CMOS technology, was chosen as the partner for Taiwan’s IC collaboration project. In April 1976, the first group of engineers (19 people) set off for the US and brought back the technology. In October 1977, Taiwan’s very first IC demo plant was completed. The IC technology transfer was successful and the production surpassed the 50% yield rate of the original RCA plant.
Taiwan’s First Commercial IC-CIC001
In 1976, ITRI began to assemble Taiwan's first CMOS IC demonstration production line in Building 15 under the supervision of Ding-Hua Hu, then General Director of the Electronics Research & Service Organization. Over 30 engineers who underwent training at RCA in the US, including Dr. Chin-Tay Shih, returned to Taiwan in 1977 and began IC technology research and development in the newly-completed Building 15. Their research results allowed Taiwan's IC industry to secure a world-leading position.
3-inch Silicon Wafer
ITRI signed the CMOS IC Technology Transfer Licensing Agreement with RCA, successfully introducing 3-inch silicon wafer and semiconductor manufacturing process technology.
Hsien-Hsiu Hsu
In 1973, Dr. Hsu, who was the Minister of the National Science Council of Executive Yuan, visited the US, Europe, Japan, and Korea to observe their technology development and learn why they were so successful. Later he suggested that Taiwan should establish science parks to attract major international companies to come to invest and set up production facilities. This would also stimulate the development of technology industries and encourage overseas talents to return home and start their businesses. Hsinchu already had certain technology R&D capabilities and talents as well as research and academic institutions such as ITRI, National Tsing Hua University, and National Chiao Tung University; thus, Dr. Hsu strongly recommended setting up a science park in Hsinchu.
In 1978, Dr. Hsu assumed office as the second Chairman of ITRI. During his term, he encouraged the development of semiconductors and personal computers, laying down a strong foundation for emerging high-tech industries in Taiwan. Dr. Hsu was an Academician of the Academia Sinica. He received an Outstanding Contribution Award and Honorary Doctorate from Purdue University and an Honorary Doctorate from NTHU.
Presidential Proclamation for ITRI Establishment Act
President Chiang Kai-Shek formally proclaimed the Industrial Technology Research Institute Establishment Act on January 31, 1973. The establishment of ITRI marked an important milestone for Taiwan's industrial technology R&D and the development of scientific research systems.
The No. 2 Chinese-Language Computer
To provide Chinese localization of computers and improve national competitiveness, ITRI developed its No. 2 Chinese-language computer that can display and carry out data compilation in Chinese, and applied it to the Telecommunication Training Institute under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.
Dr. Yun-Suan Sun is instrumental in forging the establishment of ITRI.
Yun-Suan Sun served as the Minister of Economic Affairs (MOEA) in 1969 when Taiwan was facing various diplomatic and economic challenges. Dr. Sun firmly believed that Taiwan’s economy could only fully transform and take off by transitioning from labor-intensive to technology-intensive industries. He therefore decided to merge MOEA’s three R&D institutes (the Union Industrial Research Institute, Mining Research and Service Organization, and Metal Industries Research Institute) and formed the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), in an effort to integrate resources and talents to assist Taiwan’s industries.

Dr. Sun drafted the establishment plan and defined the institute as a foundation to break governmental regulations and give scholars who have returned to Taiwan more flexibility. Initially, the establishment act for ITRI were rejected by the Legislative Yuan. After Dr. Sun spent more than a year explaining and negotiating with them, ITRI was officially established on July 5, 1973. Academician of Academia Sinica Chao-Chen Wang was the first President, and Dr. Sun was honored as the “Father of ITRI.
The Natural Gas Research Institute in 1973
The Natural Gas Research Institute was established in 1936. It was one of the central research institutions in Taiwan during the Japanese Colonial Period and was also the earliest industrial research unit in Taiwan, mainly focusing on the research of the exploitation and application of oil, natural gas, condensate and coal. After the World War II, it was renamed as the Union Industrial Research Institute (UIRI) of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. With Dr. Yun-Suan Sun’s vigorous effort, the UIRI merged with the Mining Research and Service Organization and the Metal Industries Research Institute to form the Industrial Technology Research Institute in 1973, creating a series of transformation and upgrading for Taiwan's industries.
