This set a new paradigm in Taiwan's turn-key technology transfers.\n6-inch Silicon \nWafer\nIn 1986, the VLSI demonstration factory was inaugurated at ITRI's Building 67. The facility, known as Taiwan Semiconductor Fab 1 at that time, manufactured 6-inch silicon wafers.\n生態樹 ─ 樹頂\n● 生態樹的應用情境－光合作用\n─ 概念說明：光合作用是植物利用陽光來製造能量(碳水化合物)的一種機制。\n\n─ 技術應用情境：於生態樹上方天窗架設工研院研發之「太陽能發電窗」技術，用以展示太陽能發電窗利用陽光發電的情境。\n\n─ 技術應用特色與效益：每片太陽能發電窗尺寸是110*90公分（約1平方米），發電量是18瓦；在生態樹示範面積內有20片，總發電量約360瓦。\n\n● 生態樹的應用情境－淨化空氣\n─ 概念說明：樹木透過光合作用中吸收二氧化碳與排放氧氣的過程，可達到淨化空氣的效果，此外植物散發的揮發性物質「芬多精」也可殺死空氣中的細菌、害蟲以及病原菌。\n\n─ 技術應用情境：利用生態樹冠上塗層的自然光觸媒技術，來達到抵抗空間病菌及分解有機揮發氣體(VOC)的效果。\n\n─ 技術應用特色與效益：樹冠內隱藏風扇可每小時讓整個空間換氣7次以上，並吹過光觸媒塗層區，淨化空氣。光觸媒抗菌效能可達99.99%，1g奈米光觸媒可分解20微克有機揮發性氣體（甲醛）。\nThe ITRI-A Robot\nITRI completed development of its ITRI-A robot for use in assembly lines of small components. This was Taiwan's first robot of its type, and the technology was transferred to local firms to boost automation of their production lines.\nITRI Headquaters in the 1980s\nITRI actively established industrial automation technology to assist Taiwan’s traditional industries in shifting from the labor-intensive production model to a technology-intensive one. The Institute successfully promoted the personal computer, optoelectronic, and mechanical automation industries by cultivating and transferring technologies and talents. The seeds of Taiwan's personal computer development were planted, making personal computers become the mainstream of information industry and driving the establishment and development of new industries.\nChung-Mou Chang\nChung-Mou Chang received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University. Dr. Chang started his career at Sylvania Semiconductor, and served as Group Senior Vice-President at Texas Instrument, and as President & COO at General Instrument Corporation. He later founded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). \n\nIn 1985, Dr. Chang was invited by then ITRI Chairman Hsien-Hsiu Hsu to return to Taiwan and serve as the third President of ITRI. During his term, Dr. Chang initiated many reforms. He employed an American management style and launched a hiring system to encourage ITRI to be constantly innovative and creative. In 1988, Dr. Chang served as ITRI’s third Chairman and continued supporting ITRI to apply research results to the industry. By bridging the gap between research and industry, ITRI secured its role as one of the world’s leading R&D institutions.\nIn 1986, ITRI set up the spinoff TSMC with Chang as its Chairman. In 2000, Dr. Chang was awarded the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Robert N. Noyce Medal. In 2011, he received the IEEE Medal of Honor, and was named as one of the first ITRI Laureates in 2012.\nOtto C. C. Lin\nOtto C. C. Lin received his bachelor’s degree from National Taiwan University, and master’s and Ph.D. degrees in macromolecular science from Columbia University. He worked as a researcher and research director at DuPont. Later he returned to Taiwan and taught at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) as a professor. Dr. Lin served as the Dean of the College of Engineering at NTHU in 1978, during which he launched collaboration projects between the university and industries. He also set up the Center for Materials Science and facilitated many large material technology collaboration research projects, establishing the foundation for Taiwan’s polymer science.\nIn 1983, Dr. Lin became the General Director of ITRI’s Materials Research Laboratories. He headed the six-year national industrial material technology project and was awarded the Excellent Research Result Award from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. In 1986, Dr. Lin was elected as the President of the Materials Research Society-Taiwan (MRS-T) and held the post for four years. During his term, MRS-T was evaluated as an “Outstanding Group” by the Ministry of the Interior. Dr. Lin also received the Chih-Hung Lu Memorial Award from MRS-T.\nIn 1988, Dr. Lin served as the fourth President of ITRI. He emphasized the R&D of advanced technology and expanded the connection with industries by providing industrial services. This assisted in the development of Taiwan’s high-tech industries and the upgrading of traditional small and medium-sized enterprises. Under his leadership, ITRI also transferred many technologies to companies, including integrated circuits, laptops, optoelectronic components, general automobile engines, and composite materials. This set the foundation for Taiwan’s technology-intensive industry. In 1994, Dr. Lin was the winner of the Tung-Ho Outstanding Research Award - Material Science Category.\nCarbon Fiber Bicycles\nITRI developed lightweight and stiff carbon fiber composite materials to replace the use of steel or aluminum in bicycle frames.
