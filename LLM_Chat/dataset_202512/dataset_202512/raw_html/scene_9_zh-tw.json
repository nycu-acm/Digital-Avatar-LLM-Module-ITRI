He is one of the founders of Nexant and served as its Vice President and Senior Vice President.\nDr. Liu became ITRI’s ninth President in 2018 and has actively promoted three strategies: “conducting market-oriented R&D,” “being the bridge between the industries, academia, and research organizations,” and “assisting in the transformation and upgrading of industries.” He facilitated the 2030 Technology Strategy & Roadmap, successfully created the three major cultural DNAs of ITRI, and implemented business-style operations to stimulate breakthroughs within ITRI, including outstanding performances in high-quality patents, patent impact, and patent approval success rate. During Dr. Liu’s term, ITRI was named a Top 100 Global Innovator by Clarivate, making ITRI the most awarded Asian research institution. Under Dr. Liu’s leadership, ITRI was rated by LinkedIn as one of the Most Engaging Employer Brands in 2019. \nDr. Liu is the recipient of the Outstanding Technology and Contribution Award from Siemens-Empros International, Small Business Innovation Research Award from the National Science Foundation, and Outstanding Awards for excellent R&D project from PG&E. He is an IEEE Fellow and won the IEEE PES 1st Power System Conference and Exhibition Outstanding Service Awards for planning, organizing, and management; Outstanding Awards for chairmanship of the IEEE Computing and Analytical Methods; and Quanta Technology Outstanding Performance Award.\n2023.03\nITRI was named a Top 100 Global InnovatorTM by ClarivateTM for the seventh time and sixth consecutive year, making it the research institution with the most wins among Taiwanese entities and Asian research institutions.\n生態樹 ─ 樹幹\n● 生態樹的應用情境－調節溫度\n─ 概念說明：樹木也具有調節溫度的功能，透過樹蔭反射/阻隔/蒸散等功能，可調節冷熱空氣的對流與循環。\n\n─ 技術應用情境：於生態樹上方天窗架設熱氣排出口，再利用太陽能發電窗所產生的電力，驅動生態樹冠上的風扇向下吹送，造成空間氣流的循環效果。\n\n─ 技術應用特色與效益：位於樹冠內的六台風扇全開（1台由太陽能供電/5台由市電供電，每台出風量每分鐘57立方米），於中央挑高區容積(2,646立方米)，每小時可以將空氣循環約7.7次。\n\n● 生態樹的應用情境－情境照明\n─ 概念說明：樹木除了具有環境循環與調節的功能外，對人類來說還具有觀賞與造景功能。\n\n─ 技術應用情境：利用擴散光板與LED燈結合之情境照明，搭配生態樹本身的藝術造型，來營造整個空間美學的藝術內涵。此外擴散光板與LED燈也可隨時因應日照變化調節室內光線。\n\n─ 技術應用特色與效益：\n生態樹擴散光板示範效能穿透度光約70%，霧度約30%；LED燈的耗電量約3,417瓦，相對於同樣光通量之彩色鹵素燈約14,903瓦，其耗電量只有23%。\nChih-Kung Lee\nChih-Kung Lee graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at National Taiwan University (NTU) and obtained his master's and Ph.D. in theoretical and applied mechanics with a minor in physics from Cornell University. He also worked as a researcher at IBM Almaden Research Center in California. After returning to Taiwan, Dr. Lee taught at the Institute of Applied Mechanics at NTU as an associate professor, professor, and Distinguished Professor. He set up the MEMS Lab at the Institute, and also served as the Director of the Division of Strategic Planning, Office of Research and Development at NTU. Dr. Lee later worked as the Director of Biomedical Research & Development at the Hsinchu Biomedical Science Park Planning Office; Director-General of Engineering & Applied Sciences at the National Science Council, Executive Yuan; Consultant at the Taiwan Intellectual Property Training Academy; ITRI’s Executive Vice President; President of the Institute for Information Industry; Adjunct Research Fellow at the Research Center for Applied Sciences, Academia Sinica; Co-Chair of the University-Industry Advisory Committee, Ministry of Science and Technology; and Minister of Economic Affairs.\nDr. Lee’s area of research includes automation technology, optoelectronic and piezoelectric systems, and micro-electromechanical and biomedical technologies. In 2003 when the SARS epidemic broke out, Dr. Lee and his research team leveraged the biomedicine technology to develop “Taida No.1 anti-SARS chemicals” in 20 days.\nIn 2017, Dr. Lee became the thirteenth Chairman of ITRI. During his term, he actively connected the industry, government, academia, and research institutions. He implemented strategic planning and supervised organizational transformation to increase ITRI’s contribution to the industries, society, and nation. He also integrated research, service, and pedagogy to pass on the knowledge. In the field of R&D and industrial applications, he launched cross-domain integrations to help Taiwanese industries enter the international arena and gradually realize ITRI’s goal of using innovative technology to create new emerging markets for industries.\n2024.04\nITRI triumphed at the Edison AwardsTM for the eighth time, winning one gold and three silvers with four exceptional technology breakthroughs: the Novel Dual-Targeted Therapy for Glaucoma, Key Functional Cell Identity (KFCI), PureTex Sustainable Decolorization Solution, and the High Resolution Full Color Micro LED Display. The Novel Dual-Targeted Therapy for Glaucoma marked Taiwan’s first Edison gold victory for ophthalmic drug innovations in the health, medicine, and biotech category.\n2024.03\nITRI was named a Top 100 Global InnovatorTM 2024 by ClarivateTM, being one of the only three national research organizations on the 2024 list. Receiving the honor for the eighth time, ITRI is the most awarded organization among Asian research institutions.\n2023.11\nITRI won a total of eight R&D 100 Awards, the highest number of awards in Asia and the second-highest in the world.
