    "History": "In 1982, the new Materials Research Laboratories (MRL) was established under ITRI andOtto C.C. Linwas appointed Founding Director.\nIn 2002, ITRI partnered withApex Medicaland started the development ofrespiratory therapyproduct series. This was one of Apex Medical's first major collaborations.\nIn 2019, ITRI banned all smartphones and computers made by China'sHuaweifrom their internal network for security reasons.[6][7]China'sTaiwan Affairs Officereacted negatively to the decision with their spokesperson saying that the decision \"jeopardizes the mainland and Taiwan's regular economic cooperation for political purposes\".[8]\nIn summer 2025 ITRI ceased its involvement in theTaiwan Space Agency's 5G LEO communications satellite project saying that they had realized that satellites were outside of their area of expertise. ITRI was replaced by private firms.[9]\nInnovations and applications[edit]",
    "Innovations and applications": "Self-driving cars[edit]",
    "Self-driving cars": "As of 2019, self-driving cars designed by ITRI had accumulated more than 2,000 km of testing in the Changhua Coastal Industrial Park.[10]\nStarFab[edit]",
    "StarFab": "StarFab is atech acceleratorfounded by ITRI focusing on innovation in the fields ofsmart manufacturing, smart medical care, smart finance and smart agriculture.[11]It is headquartered inTaipeiwith an office in theTainan Science Park.[12]\nR&D focus[edit]",
    "R&D focus": "Smart Livinginvolves efforts to integrate technologies in information and communication technologies (ICT), cloud services, big data, etc., to develop smart services, logistics, and next-generation handheld devices.[13]Quality Healthfocuses on the development of innovative therapeutic biologics, composite medical materials and instruments along with healthcare assistance technologies.[14]Sustainable Environmentcenters on green energy, smart transportation, biomass, advanced green manufacturing, and disaster relief technologies.[15]Intelligentization Enabling Technologyincludes AI, semiconductor, communications, cybersecurity, and cloud technologies to support technology breakthrough, and ensure data privacy and information safety.[16]\nSee also[edit]",
